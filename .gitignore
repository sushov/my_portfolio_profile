# Terraform State Files (The "Brain" - HIGH RISK)

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sentitive data
*.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually local overrides
override.tf

*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Ignore CLI configuration files

# GOOGLE CLOUD KEYS (CRITICAL)
# Block any JSON file that looks like a key
*.json
# (Exception: If you have legitimate config JSONs, be careful here. 
#  But for this project, blocking *.json is the safest move).

# Mac System Files (Junk)
.DS_Store
